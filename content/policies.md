### Activities & Assessments
The following activities and assessments will help you successfully achieve the course learning objectives. By experiencing the course content in different ways, you will not only gain a better understanding of regression analysis, but you will also get experiences that can guide you as you apply what you've learned in future academic and professional projects.
<br> 
<br>

#### Homework (25%)

In homework, you will apply what you've learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Homework must be typed up using R Markdown and submitted in the appropriate GitHub repository. 

*The lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.*
<br> 
<br>

#### Labs (15%)

In labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. You will work on lab assignments in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team's Git repository on the course's GitHub page as as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member's relative contribution for each lab. You will also be asked to evaluate your team members' performance periodically during the semester. 

*The lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.*
<br> 
<br>

#### Exams (Exam I: 20%, Exam II: 20%)

The exams are an opportunity to assess the knowledge and skills you’ve learned. They will include both the mathematical and conceptual aspects of regression. Both exams will be given during a lecture class period, and you will be permitted to bring one page of hand-written notes to each exam.


<br> 
<br>

#### Final Project (15%)

The purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-based research question using regression. The project will be completed in teams, and each team will present their results during the final exam period, Wednesday, May 1, 2p - 5p. *You must complete the final project and present your work in class to pass the course.*
<br> 
<br>

<!--
#### Application Exercises (10%)

Application exercises give you an opportunity to practice using the statistical concepts and/or code discussed in lecture on short data analyses. They will typically be started during class and may be assigned to be completed by the next class meeting. In general, these assignments are shorter than homework assignments and will be completed in teams. 
<br> 
<br>
-->

#### Teamwork (5%)

To construct functional and diverse teams, you will be asked to complete a short survey to gauge your previous exposure to programming topics. After completing the survey, you will be assigned to teams of 3-4 students; these teams will stay consistent throughout the semester (barring extraordinary circumstances). You will work in these teams during class, on lab assignments, and on the final project.
<br> 
<br>

#### Grade Calculation

The final grade will be calculated as follows:
 
{.table .table2 .table-condensed .table-striped .text-left}
 <span></span>     | <span></span>  
-----------|---------------------------------
Homework | 25%
Labs | 15%
Exam I | 20%
Exam II | 20%
Final Project | 15%
Teamwork | 5%

If you have a cumulative numerical average of 90 - 100, you are guaranteed at least an A-, 80 - 89 at least a B-, and 70 - 79 at least a C-. The exact ranges for letter grades will be determined after Exam 2.

<br> 
<br>

### Make-up Policy

Students who miss a class due to a scheduled varsity trip, religious holiday, or short-term illness should fill out an online [NOVAP](https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/athletic-varsity-participation), [Religious Observance Notification](https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/religious-holidays), or [STINF](http://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/illness), respectively. These excused absences do not excuse you from assigned homework. It will still be your responsibility to submit relevant assignments in accordance with the deadline.

If you have a personal or family emergency or health condition that affects your ability to participate in class, you should contact your academic dean's office. More information about this procedure may be found on the [Personal Emergencies page](https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/personal-emergencies) or provided by your academic dean.

**Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given.** If you must miss an exam, your absence must be officially excused before the exam due date. If your absence is excused, the missing exam grade will be imputed at the end of the semester based on your performance on other relevant course assignments.

The final project presentations will  be during the university scheduled exam period, Wednesday, May 1, 2p - 5p. **You must complete the final project and present your work during the exam period in order to pass the course.**
<br> 
<br>

### Late Work

Homework or lab assignments submitted late but within 24 hours of the deadline may be accepted with a 20% penalty. Homework or lab assignments submitted any later will not be accepted.

**Late work will not be accepted for the exams or the final project.**
<br> 
<br>



### Academic Honesty

By enrolling in this course, you have agreed to abide by and uphold the provisions of the  [Duke Community Standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard) as well as the policies specific to this course. Any violations will automatically result in a grade of 0 on the  assignment and will be reported to [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct) for further action.

- You may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.
- **Reusing code**: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must or explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. 

On individual assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with other students. On team assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.
<br>
