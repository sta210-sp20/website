## Meet Your TA!

---

## Introduce Yourself!

- Name

- Major or intended major

- Share a boring fact about yourself 

---

## Today's Agenda

1. Questions about the syllabus 

2. What to expect in lab

3. Lab 01 intro and demos: Introduce the lab, and work through the first section as a class.

4. On your own: Work on the rest of the lab "on your own", but feel free to check in with classmates as much as you like.

### Any questions about the syllabus?

## What to expect in lab

- Introduction to the lab assignment (~ 5 - 10 min, longer today)

- Work on the lab assignment (individual today, but generally done in teams)

- Lab slides and instructions posted in the schedule on the course website under <i class="fa fa-file-code-o fa-lg"></i>
    + Go to the course website to find today's lab instructions.

- All assignments will be completed using RStudio and GitHub
    + You will submit your GitHub repo on Gradescopes

---

## Tips

- You do not have to finish the lab in class, they will always be due the following Tuesday at 11:59p. One work strategy is to get through portions that you think will be most challenging (which initially might be the coding component) during lab when a TA can help you on the spot and leave the narrative writing until later.

- Do not pressure each other to finish early; use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality lab report.

## Lab 01 intro and demos

---

## Goals

<small>
- **Introduce you to R and RStudio:**
    + R is the name of the programming language itself 
    + RStudio is a convenient interface
    + Access RStudio through the Docker container on Duke VM Manage - UPDATE LINK!


- **Introduce you to Git and GitHub:** collaboration and version control system that we will be using throughout the course
    + Git is a version control system -- like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word on steroids
    + GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet
    
- **Take small steps:**
    + This a solo lab to make versioning (working with Git) simpler
    + Next week youâ€™ll learn about collaborating on GitHub and produce a single lab report for the team

## Getting started 

You may watch or follow along: 

- Find the GitHub repo with the prefix `lab-01-review-r`. 

- On GitHub, click on the green **Clone or download button**, select **Use HTTPS** if it is not already selected. Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers and login with your Duke NetId and Password.

- Click to log into the Docker container **STA 210 - Regression Analysis**. You should now see the RStudio environment. 

---

## Getting started 

- Go to *File* `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` *New Project* `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` *Version Control* `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` *Git*. 

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*. You can leave the direct name empty. It will default to the name of the GitHub repo.


- Click *Create Project*, and you should see the contents from your GitHub repo in the **Files** pane in RStudio. 

<br><br>

Now it's your turn! When you're done with this part, you may continue if you like or wait until I demonstrate the next part. Please raise your hand if you have any questions.

## Configure git - DO I STILL NEED THIS STEP??

<!--
Next, we need to configure git so RStudio and GitHub can communicate with each other. 

You may watch or follow along: 

- Type the following lines of code in the **console**: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="your name", user.email="your email")
```

- If you get an error message, it may be because you need to install the `usethis` package. You can type the code below in the console to install the package

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("usethis")
```

Once you're configured git, you're ready to complete the rest of lab!\
