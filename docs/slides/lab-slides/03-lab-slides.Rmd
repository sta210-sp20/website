## Agenda

1. Outline: Inference for Regression

2.  Tips for collaborating in GitHub 

3.  Starting a new project & lab tips


---

### Confidence interval for $\beta_1$

The confidence interval for the regression slope is 

.alert[
$$\mathbf{\hat{\beta}_1 \pm t^* SE(\hat{\beta}_1)}$$
]


**Interpretation**: We are *C%* confident that for every one unit increase in $x$, $y$ is predicted to *[increase/decrease]* on average by *LB* to *UB*. 

---

### Outline of hypothesis Test for $\beta_1$

**Hypotheses: ** 
$$\begin{aligned}& H_0: \beta_1 = 0\\& H_a: \beta_1 \neq 0\end{aligned}$$

**Test Statistic:**
$$t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_1 - 0}{SE(\hat{\beta}_1)}$$

**p-value:** calculated calculated from a $t$ distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom

$$\text{p-value} = P(t \geq |\text{test statistic}|)$$ 

<br>

**Conclusion:** reject/fail to reject $H_0$ based on p-value

### Tips for collaborating via GitHub

- Always pull first before you start working.

- Knit, commit, and push often to minimize merge conflicts and/or to make merge conflicts easier to resolve. (More on merge conflicts next week)

- If you find yourself in a situation that is difficult to resolve, ask questions as soon as possible, don't let it linger and get bigger.

## Lab Introduction

- In today's lab, you will be analyzing data from the food menu at Starbucks. 

- The focus of the lab is to give you practice conducting statistical inference and prediction for simple linear regression. 

- This will also give you more practice establishing a team workflow by following the guided prompts throughout the lab.

---

## Starting a new project

- Go to the course GitHub organization and find the **lab-03-slr-inf** repo that has your team name on it.

- On GitHub, click on the green Clone or download button, select Use HTTPS (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, youâ€™ll see the text Clone with HTTPS). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the course workspace. Create a New Project from Git Repo. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the New Project button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box and click OK. 

---

## Configure Git

- Type the following lines of code in the console in RStudio filling in your name and email address.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="GITHUB USERNAME", user.email="your email")
```

---

## Tips for Lab

- Each group member should commit and push to GitHub at least once

- It is good practice to name your R code chunks. Do not put spaces in the code chunk names.

- Check the .md file on GitHub to make sure it has all of your work, including output and graphs.
