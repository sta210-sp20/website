## Merge Conflicts
 
---

### What are merge conflicts?

When two collaborators make changes to a file and push the file to their repo, 
git merges these two files.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=300, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03/merge-no-conflict.png")
```

If these two files have conflicting content on the same line, git will produce a <font class="vocab">merge conflict</font>.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=300, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03/merge-conflict.png")
```

---

## Resolving merge conflicts

- Merge conflicts need to be resolved manually, as they require a human intervention

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=800, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03/merge-conflict-identifiers.png")
```

- To resolve the merge conflict
  - decide if you want to keep only your text or the text on GitHub or 
  incorporate changes from both texts
  - delete the conflict markers `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` and make the 
  changes you want in the final merge

---

### Practce dealing with merge conflicts

We will walk through an activity as a class to practice dealing with merge conflicts.

.alert[
- Clone the lab-04-merge-conflict repo and start a new R project. 
- Assign numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 to each team member. 

`r emo::ji('stop_sign')` Wait for instructions before moving on to the next step.
]

---

### Let's cause a merge conflict!

- We will take turns in completing the exercise, only one member at a time.

- All other members should get up and look over the shoulder of the member who is doing the exercise.

---

### Team Member 1

.alert[
- Change the text **`This is line 1 of text`** to something else, e.g. **`I love regression!`**.
- Commit and push.

`r emo::ji('stop_sign')` Wait for instructions before moving on to the next step.
]

---

### Team Member 2

.alert[
- Do not pull!
- Change the text **`This is line 1 of text`**. to something else, e.g. **`R is fun!`**
- Commit and attempt to push, you should get an error.
- Read the error message as a group.
- Pull.
- Take a look at the document with the merge conflict. Clear the merge conflict by choosing the correct/preferred change.
- Commit, and push.

`r emo::ji('stop_sign')` Wait for instructions before moving on to the next step.
]

---

### Team Member 3

.alert[
- Do not pull!
- Change the text **`This is line 2 of text`**. to something else, e.g. **`I love statistics!`**
- Commit and attempt to push, you should get an error.
- Read the error message as a group.
- Pull.
- No merge conflicts should occur. Now push.

`r emo::ji('stop_sign')` Wait for instructions before moving on to the next step.
]

---

### Team Member 4

.alert[
- Change the text **`This is line 2 of text`**. to something else, e.g. **`This is the last one!`**`
- Commit and attempt to push. You should get an error.
- Read the error message as a group.
- Pull.
- Take a look at the document with the merge conflict.
- Clear the merge conflict by choosing the correct/preferred change.
- Commit, and push.

`r emo::ji('stop_sign')` Wait for instructions before moving on to the next step.
]

---

### All Group Members

.alert[
- Back to your seats.
- Pull, and observe the changes in your document.
]

---


### Tips for collaborating via GitHub

- Always pull first before you start working.

- Knit, commit, and push often to minimize merge conflicts and/or to make merge conflicts easier to resolve.

- If you find yourself in a situation that is difficult to resolve, ask questions asap, don't let it linger and get bigger.

### Lab introduction 

- <font class="vocab">Goal: </font> Use ANOVA to compare group means 

- <font class="vocab">Data:</font> `diamonds` data set in the ggplot2 package  


- Learn about attributes of diamonds: 
    - [https://www.gia.edu/diamond-quality-factor](https://www.gia.edu/diamond-quality-factor)

- Today's lab will focus on the cut and price for diamonds that weight 0.5 carats

### Getting started

See the "Getting Started" instructions in [Lab 01](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring20/sta210.001/labs/lab-01-review-r.html#getting-started) if you need a reminder about cloning a repo and starting a new project.
