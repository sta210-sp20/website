### Lab 07: Logistic Regression

<font class="vocab">Goal: </font> Fit a logistic regression model to predict the probability a Spotify user will like a song
- This week will focus on exploratory data analysis and model fit. Next week, you will assess the fit of the model and use it to predict if a user likes selected songs

<font class="vocab">Data: </font> Song characteristics from Spotify.com and like/dislike from a Spotify user
- You will download the data from the lab instructions and upload it into the data folder of your project. 
- Links to the dataset are in the Data section of the instructions.

**Use the lecture notes on logistic regression for help with coding and interpretations.**

### Getting started with the lab

- Go to the course GitHub organization and find the **lab-07** repo that has your team name on it.

- On GitHub, click on the green Clone or download button, select Use HTTPS (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, youâ€™ll see the text Clone with HTTPS). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the course workspace. Create a New Project from Git Repo. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the New Project button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box and click OK. 

- Run the following in the console to configure Git:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="github username", 
               user.email="your email")
```

- **Use the email address associated with your GitHub account**

---

### Caching your password

You need to cache your password on a per-project basis: 

- Go to the **Terminal** within a project (the most recent lab?)
- Type the following to cache your password for $60 * 60 * 24 * 7 = 604800$ seconds

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 604800'
```

You will need to enter your GitHub username and password one more time after caching the password. After that you won't need to enter your credentials for 604800 seconds = 7 days.

---

### Project

- If you finish the lab early, you should use the remaining time to work on the project proposal 

- Details about the proposal may be found in the [project instructions](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Fall19/sta210.001/project/project.html)

- Please let your TA know if you have any questions about the proposal or finding data
