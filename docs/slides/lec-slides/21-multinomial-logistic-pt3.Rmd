### HW 05: Interpreting interaction term 

- .vocab[Response ]: `log_odds_removed`

```{r echo = F}
moth <- read_csv("data/moth.csv")
moth <- mutate(moth, notremoved = PLACED - REMOVED, 
               log_odds_removed = log(REMOVED / notremoved),
               prop_removed = REMOVED / PLACED, 
               dark = ifelse(MORPH=="dark",1,0), 
               distance = DISTANCE, 
               morph = MORPH)
```

```{r echo=F}
model1 <- lm(log_odds_removed ~ distance + morph + distance * morph, data = moth)
tidy(model1) %>% select(term, estimate) %>%
  kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)
```

.question[
.small[
*"For every 1 km increase in distance, the log-odds that a light moth is removed from the tree trunk is (-0.028 + 0.018) = -0.01 times the log-odds of a dark moth being removed from the tree trunk."*

1. Why is this interpretation incorrect?
2. Rewrite the interpretation of the interaction effect in terms of `log_odds_removed`.

1. Write the interpretation of the interaction effect in terms of the **odds** a moth is removed.

### Multinomial Logistic Regression

### Practice: *Sesame Street*

- We will analyze data from an [experiment by the Educational Testing Service](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED122799.pdf) to test the effectiveness of the children's program *Sesame Street*, an educational program designed to teach young children basic educational skills such as counting and the alphabet

- As part of the experiment, children were assigned to one of two groups: those who were encouraged to watch the program and those who were not

- The show is only effective if children watch it, so we want to understand what effect the encouragement had on the frequency of viewing after adjusting for other characteristics


---

### Response Variable

.pull-left[ 

<font class="vocab">`viewcat`</font>
  + 1: rarely watched show
  + 2: once or twice a week
  + 3: three to five times a week
  + 4: watched show on average more than five times a week
]

```{r echo = F}

### Analysis 

- Make a copy of the **Sesame Street** project in RStudio Cloud

- Make sure your group's answers are recorded in one team member's RStudio Cloud project.
  - At the top of the project, write the names of the members' who are working on the appex. 
  - Submit the name of the team member recording the responses: https://forms.gle/pN6k1M8J3twXwThs6

- Other team members can follow along in RStudio Cloud or using the [instructions](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Fall19/sta210.001/appex/21-multinomial-logistic.html).
