### Is it rude to recline your seat on a plane?


```{r}
flying <- flying %>%
  filter(!is.na(recline_rude)) %>%
  mutate(rude = if_else(recline_rude %in% 
                          c("Somewhat", "Very"), 1, 0))
```

### Response Variable, $Y$ 

- $Y$ is a binary response variable 
  + 1: yes
  + 0: no

- $Mean(Y) = p$
  + $p$ is the proportion of "yes" responses in the population
  
- $Variance(Y) = p(1-p)$

---

### Sampling Distribution of Sample Proportion 

- $\color{blue}{\hat{p}}$ : average of binary responses in the sample
  + Called the <font color="blue">sample proportion</font>
  + This is the statistic, i.e. the estimate of $p$
  
- Given $\hat{p}$ is the sample proportion based on a sample of size $n$ from a population with population proportion $p$: 

$$\hat{p} \sim N\bigg(p, \frac{p(1-p)}{n}\bigg)$$

...assuming $n$ is "large" (more than 5 "yes" and 5 "no")

---

### Confidence Interval for a Single Proportion 

- Approximate $C$% confidence interval for $p$ is 

.alert[
$$\begin{aligned}&\hat{p} \pm z^* SE(\hat{p})\\[15pt]
= &\hat{p} \pm z^* \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}\\\end{aligned}$$
]

--

where $z^*$ is the critical value calculated from the $N(0,1)$ distribution 

--

```{r}
# Critical value for 90% CI
qnorm(0.95)
```

---

### Opinions about reclining: 90% CI

```{r}
crit.val <- qnorm(0.95)
```

```{r}
flying %>%
  summarise(n = n(), 
            p_hat = sum(rude)/n, 
            se = sqrt(p_hat*(1-p_hat)/n), 
            lb = p_hat - crit.val*se,
            ub = p_hat + crit.val*se)
```

```{r echo=F}
lb <- flying %>%
  summarise(n = n(), 
            p_hat = sum(rude)/n, 
            se = sqrt(p_hat*(1-p_hat)/n), 
            LB = p_hat - crit.val*se) %>% pull()

ub <- flying %>%
  summarise(n = n(), 
            p_hat = sum(rude)/n, 
            se = sqrt(p_hat*(1-p_hat)/n), 
            UB = p_hat + crit.val*se) %>% pull()
```

We are 90% confident that the interval `r round(lb,3)` to `r round(ub,3)` contains the true proportion of fliers who think reclining your seat on a plane is rude.

### Sampling Distribution for Difference in Two Proportions

- Let $\hat{p}_1$ and $\hat{p}_2$ be sample proportions from independent random samples of size $n_1$ and $n_2$, respectively: 

$$\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2 \sim N\bigg(p_1 - p_2, \frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}\bigg)$$
<br>

... assuming $n_1$ and $n_2$ are "large" (at least 5 "yes" and "no" in each sample)
---

### Confidence Interval for Difference in Proportions

- Approximate $C$% confidence interval for $p_1 - p_2$ is 

$$\begin{aligned}&(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) \pm z^* \times SE(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)\\[15pt]
=~ &(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) \pm z^* \times \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}\end{aligned}$$

where $z^*$ is the critical value calculated from the $N(0,1)$ distribution

### Opinions about reclining by age

```{r echo = F}
flying %>% 
  filter(age %in% c("18-29", "30-44")) %>%
  group_by(age, rude) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  spread(rude, n) %>%
  kable(format="markdown")
```

--

**Is there a significant difference in the proportion of 18-29 year olds versus 30-44 year olds who think reclining a seat on a plane is rude?**

---

### Opinions about reclining by age: 90% CI

```{r}
flying %>% 
  filter(age %in% c("18-29", "30-44")) %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), 
            p_hat = round(sum(rude)/n,3)) %>% kable(format="markdown")
```

.question[
1. Calculate a 90% confidence interval for the difference in proportion of 18-29 year olds and 30-44 year olds who think reclining a seat on a plane is rude. Interpret the interval. 

3. Based on the interval, is there evidence of a significant difference in proportions between the two groups?

**What are some potential difficulties with reporting results using the difference in proportions? Or proportions/percentages in general?**

---

### Odds

- Given $p$, the population proportion of "yes" responses, the corresponding <font class="vocab3">odds</font> of a "yes" response is 

$$\omega = \frac{p}{1-p}$$


- The *sample odds* are $\hat{\omega} = \frac{\hat{p}}{1-\hat{p}}$

```{r echo=F}
p_hat <- flying %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), 
            p_hat = round(sum(rude)/n,3)) %>% pull()
```

- **Ex.**
  + proportion of fliers who think reclining is rude: `r p_hat`.
  + odds a flier thinking reclining is rude: `r round(p_hat/(1-p_hat),3)` to 1

---

### Properties of the odds

- $\text{odds } \geq 0$

- If $\hat{p} = 0.5$, then odds $=1$

- If odds of "yes" $=\omega$, then the odds of "no" $=\frac{1}{\omega}$

- If odds of "yes" $=\omega$, then $\hat{p} = \frac{\omega}{(1+\omega)}$ 

---

### Odds ratio

- Suppose we have two populations with proportions $p_1$ and $p_2$ and odds $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$

- The <font class="vocab">odds ratio</font> is $\phi = \frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2}$
  + *Estimate*: $\hat{\phi} = \frac{\hat{\omega}_1}{\hat{\omega}_2}$

- Good alternative to the difference in proportions

- .vocab[Intepretation]: The odds of "yes" in group 1 is $\phi$ times the odds of "yes" in group 2

---

### Why use Odds Ratio? 

- In practice, the odds ratio is more consistent across levels of confounding variables 

- The odds ratio is more easily interpreted / understood 

- The odds ratio can be easily extended to regression analysis

---

### Sampling distribution of log(odds ratio)

- Let $\hat{\omega}_1$ and $\hat{\omega}_2$ be sample odds from independent random samples of size $n_1$ and $n_2$, respectively: 

$$\log(\hat{\phi}) = \log\bigg(\frac{\hat{\omega}_1}{\hat{\omega}_2}\bigg) \approx N\bigg(\log\bigg(\frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2}\bigg), \frac{1}{n_1p_1(1-p_1)} + \frac{1}{n_2p_2(1-p_2)}\bigg)$$
<br>

... assuming $n_1$ and $n_2$ are "large" based on the thresholds for difference in proportions


---

### Confidence Interval for Log Odds Ratio

- Approximate $C$% confidence interval for $\log(\phi)$ is 

.alert[
$$\begin{aligned}&\log(\hat{\phi}) \pm z^* \times SE[\log(\hat{\phi})]\\[15pt]
=\hspace{2mm} &\log(\hat{\phi}) \pm z^* \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)} + \frac{1}{n_2\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}}\\\end{aligned}$$
]

--

where $z^*$ is the critical value calculated from the $N(0,1)$ distribution 

---

### Confidence Interval for Odds Ratio

Suppose $LB$ and $UB$ are the lower and upper bounds of the $C$% confidence interval for the log odds ratio, $\log(\phi)$

.alert[
The $C$% confidence interval for the odds ratio, $\phi$ is 

$$\exp\{LB\} \text{ to }\exp\{UB\}$$
]

---

### Opinions about reclining seat

```{r}
flying %>% 
  filter(age %in% c("18-29", "30-44")) %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), 
            p_hat = round(sum(rude)/n,3),
            odds = round(p_hat/(1-p_hat),3))
```

.question[
1. Calculate a 90% confidence interval for the odds ratio of 18-29 versus 30-44 year olds who think reclining a seat on a plane is rude. Interpret the interval.

2. Based on the interval, is there evidence of a significant difference in the odds between the two groups?
]

---

### Hypothesis Test for Odds Ratio

- We want to test whether two groups have equal odds, i.e. $\phi = \frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2} =1$

- <font class="vocab">Null Hypothesis: </font> $H_0: \log(\phi) = \log\big(\frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2}\big) = 0$

- <font class="vocab">Test Statistic: </font>
$$ z = \frac{\log(\hat{\phi}) - 0}{SE_0[\log(\hat{\phi})]} = \frac{\log(\hat{\phi}) - 0}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1\hat{p}_c(1-\hat{p}_c)} + \frac{1}{n_2\hat{p}_c(1-\hat{p}_c)}}}$$


- <font class="vocab">p-value: </font>proportion of $N(0,1)$ distribution as extreme or more extreme than the test statistic 

---

### Standard error $SE_0[\log(\hat{\phi})]$

- The null hypothesis is that odds ratio is 1, i.e.  the proportions are equal

- To calculate standard error, we estimate $\hat{\pi}_c$, the sample proportion from the combined data
 
$$SE_0[\log(\hat{\phi})] =SE_0\bigg[\log\bigg(\frac{\hat{\omega}_1}{\hat{\omega}_2}\bigg)\bigg] = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n_1\hat{p}_c(1-\hat{p}_c)} + \frac{1}{n_2\hat{p}_c(1-\hat{p}_c)}}$$

---

### Opinions about reclining seat

**Do the odds of thinking it's rude to recline a seat on a plane differ between 18-29 and 30-44 year olds?**

```{r echo=F}
p_c <- flying %>% 
  filter(age %in% c("18-29", "30-44")) %>%
  summarise(p_c = round(sum(rude)/n(),3)) %>% pull()
```

```{r echo=F}
n <- flying %>% 
  filter(age %in% c("18-29", "30-44")) %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>% pull()

odds <- flying %>% 
  filter(age %in% c("18-29", "30-44")) %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), p_hat = round(sum(rude)/n,3),
            odds = round(p_hat/(1-p_hat),3)) %>% pull()
```

$$\begin{aligned}&H_0: \log(\phi) = 0\\
&H_a: \log(\phi) \neq 0\\\end{aligned}$$

- $\hat{p}_c$ = `r p_c`

- **18 - 29**: $n =$ `r n[1]`, $\hat{\omega} =$ `r odds[1]`

- **30 - 44**: $n =$ `r n[2]`, $\hat{\omega} =$ `r odds[2]`

.question[
1. Calculate the test statistic. 
2. Calculate p-value and make a conclusion.
