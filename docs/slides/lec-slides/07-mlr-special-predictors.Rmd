## Math Details 


---

### Regression Model 

- The multiple linear regression model assumes 

.alert[
$$y|x_1, x_2,  \ldots, x_p \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_p x_p, \sigma^2)$$
]

--

- For a given observation $(x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ip}, y_i)$, we can rewrite the previous statement as 

.alert[
$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \dots + \beta_p x_{ip} + \epsilon_{i} \hspace{10mm} \epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$$
]
---

### Estimating $\sigma^2$

- For a given observation $(x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots,x_{ip}, y_i)$ the residual is 

.alert[
$$e_i = y_{i} - (\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_{i1} + \hat{\beta}_{2} x_{i2} + \dots + \hat{\beta}_p x_{ip})$$
]

--

- The estimated value of the regression variance , $\sigma^2$, is 

.alert[
$$\hat{\sigma}^2  = \frac{RSS}{n-p-1} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^ne_i^2}{n-p-1}$$
]

---

### Estimating Coefficients 

- One way to estimate the coefficients is by taking partial derivatives of the formula

$$\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n}[y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} \dots + \beta_p x_{ip})]^2$$

--

- This produces messy formulas, so instead we can use matrix notation for multiple linear regression and estimate the coefficients using rules from linear algebra. 
    - For more details, see Section 1.2 of the textbook and the supplemental notes [Matrix Notation for Multiple Linear Regression](https://github.com/sta210-fa19/supplemental-notes/blob/master/regression-basics-matrix.pdf)
    - **Note:** You are **<u>not</u>** required to know matrix notation for MLR in this class

## Assumptions 

---

### Assumptions 

Inference on the regression coefficients and predictions are reliable only when the regression assumptions are reasonably satisfied: 

1. <font class="vocab">Linearity: </font> Response variable has a linear relationship with the predictor variables in the model

2. <font class="vocab">Constant Variance: </font>The regression variance is the same for all set of predictor variables $(x_1, \ldots, x_p)$

3. <font class="vocab">Normality: </font> For a given set of predictors $(x_1, \ldots, x_p)$, the response, $y$, follows a Normal distribution around its mean 

4. <font class="vocab">Independence: </font>All observations are independent

---

### Scatterplots 

- Look at a scatterplot of the response variable vs. each of the predictor variables in the exploratory data analysis before calculating the regression model 

- This is a good way to check for obvious departures from linearity 
    - Could be an indication that a higher order term or transformation is needed

---

### Residual Plots

- **Plot the residuals vs. the predicted values**
    - Can expose issues such at outliers or non-constant variance
    - Should have no systematic pattern 
    
- **Plot the residuals vs. each of the predictors**
    - Can expose issues between the response and a predictor variable that didn't show in the exploratory data analysis
    - Use box plots to plot residuals versus categorical predictor variables
    - Should have no systematic pattern

- **Plot a histogram and QQ-plot of the residuals**
    - Check normality 

---

### Scatterplots

```{r}
pairs(Bsal ~ Senior + Age + Educ + Exper, data = wages, 
      lower.panel = NULL)
```

- Only include a 4 - 5 variables in a single pairs plot; otherwise, the scatterplots are too small to be readable
---

### Residuals vs. Predicted Values

```{r}
wages <- wages %>% 
  mutate(predicted = predict.lm(bsal_model), residuals = resid(bsal_model))
ggplot(data=wages,aes(x=predicted, y=residuals)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="red") +
  labs(title="Residuals vs. Predicted Values") 
```

---

### Residuals vs. Predictors

```{r,echo=F}
p1 <- ggplot(data=wages,aes(x=Senior,y=residuals)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="red") +
  labs(x = "Seniority", y="Residuals")

p2 <- ggplot(data=wages,aes(x=Age,y=residuals)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="red") +
  labs(x = "Age", y="Residuals")

p3 <- ggplot(data=wages,aes(x=Educ,y=residuals)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="red") +
  labs(x = "Education", y="Residuals")

p4 <- ggplot(data=wages,aes(x=Exper,y=residuals)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="red") +
  labs(x = "Experience", y="Residuals")

plot_grid(p1,p2,p3,p4,nrow=2)
```

---

### Residuals vs. Predictors 

```{r}
ggplot(data=wages,aes(x=Female,y=residuals)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="red") +
  labs(x = "Female", 
       y="Residuals")
```

---

  labs(title="Distribution of Residuals") + 
    theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5,size=16))

## Special Predictors

---

### Interpreting the Intercept 

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(tidy(bsal_model),format="html",digits=3)
```

.question[
- Interpret the intercept. 

- Is this interpretation meaningful? Why or why not?
]

---


### Mean-Centered Variables

- To have a meaningful interpretation of the intercept, use **mean-centered** predictor variables in the model (quantitative predictors only)

- A <font class = "vocab">mean-centered variable</font> is calculated by subtracting the mean from each value of the variable, i.e. $$x_{ip} - \bar{x}_{.p}$$

- Now the intercept is interpreted as the expected value of the response at the mean value of all quantitative predictors

---

### Salary: Mean-Centered Variables

```{r}
wages <- wages %>%
  mutate(SeniorCent = Senior - mean(Senior), 
         AgeCent = Age-mean(Age), 
         EducCent = Educ - mean(Educ), 
         ExperCent = Exper - mean(Exper))
```

.pull-left[
```{r,echo=F}
ggplot(data=wages,aes(x=Senior)) + geom_histogram(fill="steelblue2",color="black") + 
labs(title="Seniority",x="Seniority")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r,echo=F}
ggplot(data=wages,aes(x=SeniorCent)) + geom_histogram(fill="green",color="black") + 
labs(title="Mean-Centered Seniority",xlab="Mean-Centered Seniority")
```
]


---

 

### Salary: Mean-Centered Variables

```{r, include=FALSE}
bsal_modelCent <- lm(Bsal ~ Female + SeniorCent + AgeCent + 
                    EducCent + ExperCent, data=wages)
kable(tidy(bsal_modelCent,conf.int=TRUE),format="html",digits=3)
wages <- wages %>% mutate(residuals=resid(bsal_modelCent))
```

.question[
**Application Exercise**: Fit the regression model using the mean-centered variables. 
- How did the model stay the same? 
- How did the model change?
]

---

### Quadratic Terms

 - Sometimes the response variable may have a quadratic relationship with one or more predictor variables
    - You can see this in a plot of the residuals vs. a predictor variable 
- Include quadratic terms in the model to capture the relationship 

- <font class="vocab">Good Practice:</font> Also include all lower order terms even if they are not significant. 
    - This helps with interpretation 
  
- You can show quadratic relationships by plotting the predicted mean response for different values of the predictors variable

- Note: The same ideas apply for higher-order polynomial terms

---

Below are plots of the residuals versus each quantitative predictor variable. 

```{r,echo=F}
p1 <- ggplot(data=wages,aes(x=Senior,y=residuals)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="red") +
  labs(x = "Seniority", y="Residuals")

p2 <- ggplot(data=wages,aes(x=Age,y=residuals)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="red") +
  labs(x = "Age", y="Residuals")

p3 <- ggplot(data=wages,aes(x=Educ,y=residuals)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="red") +
  labs(x = "Education", y="Residuals")

p4 <- ggplot(data=wages,aes(x=Exper,y=residuals)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="red") +
  labs(x = "Experience", y="Residuals")

plot_grid(p1,p2,p3,p4,nrow=2)
```

.question[
Which variables (if any) appear to have a quadratic relationship with `Bsal`?
]

---

### Indicator (dummy) variables


- Suppose there is a categorical variable with $k$ levels (categories)

- Make $k$ indicator variables (also known as dummy variables)

- Use $k-1$ of the indicator variables in the model
    - Can't uniquely estimate all $k$ variables at once if the intercept is in the model
    
- Level that doesn't have a variable in the model is called the <font class="vocab3">baseline</font>

- Coefficients interpreted as the change in the mean of the response over the baseline

---

### Indicator variables when $k=2$

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(tidy(bsal_modelCent,conf.int=TRUE),format="html",digits=3)
```

.question[
- Write the model equation used to predict the starting salary for males.

- Write the model equation used to predict the starting salary for females.
]

---

### Indicator variables when $k > 2$

**Application Exercise**: Fit a regression model with Education treated as a categorical variable. 

.question[
- What is the baseline for Education?

- Interpret the coefficient for `EducCat16`.

- What is your conclusion from the p-value of `EducCat16`?

- Write the model equation for those with 8 years of education. 

- Write the model equation for those with 16 years of education. 
]
---

### Interaction Terms

- **Case**: Relationship of the predictor variable with the response depends on the value of another predictor variable
  + This is an <font class="vocab3">interaction effect</font>
  
- Create a new interaction variable that is one predictor variable times the other in the interaction 

- <font class="vocab">Good Practice:</font> When including an interaction term, also include the associated **main effects** (each predictor variable on its own) even if they are not statistically significant
---

### Interaction effects

```{r,echo=F}
ggplot(data=wages, aes(x=Senior,y=Bsal,color = Female)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Starting Salary vs. Seniority",
       subtitle = "Male vs. Female employees",
       x = "Months at Company", 
       y = "Starting Salary", 
       color = "Female")
```

.question[
Do you think there is a significant interaction effect between `Female` and `Senior`? Why or why not?
]
