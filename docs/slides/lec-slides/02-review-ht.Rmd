### Today's Agenda

- Calculating & interpreting hypothesis tests

- Drawing conclusions using hypothesis tests and confidence intervals
---

### *Sesame Street*

- *Sesame Street* is a television series designed to teach children ages 3-5 basic education skills such as reading (e.g. the alphabet) and math (e.g. counting)

- Today we are going to analyze data from an [study conducted by the Educational Testing Service](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED122799.pdf) in the early 1970s to test the  effectiveness of the program. 

```{r fig.align="center",out.width="50%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/sesame_street.jpg")
```
---

### *Sesame Street* study

- Children from 6 locations around the United States (including Durham!) participated in the 26-week study. The children were split into two groups (`treatment`):
      + **Group 1**: Those who were encouraged to watch the show (assume watched regularly)
      + **Group 2**: Those who didn't get encouragement to watch the show (assume didn't watch regularly)

- Each child was given a test before and after the study to measure their knowledge of basic math, reading, etc.

- We will focus on the change in reading (identifying letters) scores (`change`)

### Let's look at the data

`sesame_street.csv` is available in the datasets repo on GitHub.

```{r, echo = F}
sesame_street <- read_csv("data/sesame_street.csv")
```

```{r}
sesame_street %>%
  slice(1:10)
```

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis - Univariate

```{r echo = F}
ggplot(data = sesame_street, mapping = aes(x = change)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Change in Reading Score (Post - Pre)" , 
       title = "Distribution of the Change in Reading Scores")
```

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis - Univariate

- Calculate summary statistics for `change`
<small>
```{r}
sesame_street %>%
  summarise(n = n(), min = min(change), median = median(change), max = max(change), 
            IQR = IQR(change), 
            mean = mean(change), std_dev = sd(change))
```
</small>

---

### 95% CI for mean change in reading score

The 95% confidence interval for the mean change in reading score is 

$$\mathbf{[9.384, 12.224]}$$

### Hypothesis Tests

---

### Question we want to answer

- Let's focus on the children who were encouraged to watch *Sesame Street*

- In general, those children watched the show regularly, so let's see if the show impacted their reading skills

.alert[
The mean change in reading scores after 26 weeks for children ages 3 - 5 is 11.

Is there evidence that mean change in reading score for children encouraged to watch *Sesame Street* is "significantly" different from the mean change in reading score for all children?
]

---

### Let's look at the data 

```{r echo = F, fig.height = 3}
sesame_street %>% 
  filter(treatment == "Encouraged") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = change)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(x = "Change in Reading Score", 
       title = "Change in Reading Score", 
       subtitle = "for children encouraged to watch Sesame Street")
```
```{r echo = F}
sesame_street %>% 
  filter(treatment == "Encouraged") %>%
  summarise(n = n(), mean = mean(change), std_dev = sd(change))
```

### Outline of a Hypothesis Test

- Identify the parameter of interest. 

- Identify a null hypothesis, $H_0$, that represents the baseline

- Set an alternative hypothesis, $H_a$, that represents the research question, i.e. what you're testing

- Conduct a hypothesis test under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true and calculate a p-value
    - The <font class = "vocab">p-value</font> is the probability of getting the observed outcome or a more extreme outcome given the null hypothesis is true

---

### Outline of a Hypothesis Test

- Assess the p-value. A small p-value means...
    
    a. The assumed (null) hypothesis is incorrect
    
    b. The assumed (null) hypothesis is correct and a rare event has occurred
    
- State a conclusion about the hypothesis based on the assessment of the p-value
--

  - Since event (b) is by definition rare, we will conclude a <font color = "red">"small" p-value</font> indicates that there is <font color = "red">sufficient evidence to claim that the assumed hypothesis is false</font>.
      - In other words, the data are not consistent with the assumed hypothesis 

--

  - When the p-value is <font color = "blue"> "not small"</font>, we will conclude that there is <font color = "blue">not sufficient evidence</font> to claim the assumed hypothesis is false.


---

### Identify parameter & hypotheses

- <font class="vocab">Null hypothesis, $H_0$</font>: This is the baseline hypothesis, i.e. the "there is nothing going on" hypothesis. 
    - The mean change in reading score for children encouraged to watch the show is 11 (same as the mean for all children)
<br><br>

- <font class = "vocab">Alternative hypothesis, $H_a$</font>: This is typically what you want to show, i.e. the "there is something going on" hypothesis 
    - The mean change in reading score for children encouraged to watch the show not 11 (different from the mean for all children)
    
$$H_0: \mu = 11 \\
H_a: \mu \neq 11$$


---

### Distribution $\bar{x}$ under $H_0$

- We want to draw conclusions about $\mu$, so we'll use our best guess $\bar{x}$

- Recall from the Central Limit Theorem, when certain conditions are met (they are!), we know that 

$$\bar{x} \sim N\Big(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\Big)$$

--

- We conduct a hypothesis test under the assumption that $H_0$ is true, so for this test

$$\bar{x} \sim N\Big(11, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\Big)$$



---

### Distribution $\bar{x}$ under $H_0$

- We don't know $\sigma$, so we can use the standard error $s/\sqrt{n}$ to approximate $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$.

- Thus, putting it all together, we know 

$$\bar{x} \approx N\Big(11, \frac{10.7}{\sqrt{152}}\Big)$$

--

.alert[
Given $\bar{x} \approx N\Big(11, \frac{10.7}{\sqrt{152}}\Big)$, what is the probability of observing a mean change in score at least 1.5 points away from the center (11) in a random sample of 152 children ages 3 - 5?
]

---

### Visualize


```{r echo = F, fig.height = 3}
norm_sd <- 10.7 / sqrt(152)
lower = 11 - 3 * 10.7 / sqrt(152)
upper = 11 + 3 * 10.7 / sqrt(152)

ggplot(NULL, aes(c(lower,upper))) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 11, sd = norm_sd), fill = "#00998a", xlim = c(lower, 9.5)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 11, sd = norm_sd), fill = "grey80", xlim = c(9.5, 12.5)) + 
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 11, sd = norm_sd), fill = "#00998a", xlim = c(12.5, upper)) +
  labs(x = "Sample Means", 
       title = "Approximate Distribution of the Sample Mean Under H0")
```


The shaded area represents the (approximate) probability of obtaining a sample mean at least as far away from the center as the one we observed given the true mean change is 11. 

---

### Test Statistic

- Let's quantify how "unusual" our observed sample mean is given $H_0: \mu = 11$ is true

- We'll begin by calculating how "far away" the observed mean is from the center of the distribution under $H_0$

- The .vocab[test statistic] is the number of standard errors the observed value is from the hypothesized value. The general form of the test statistic is 
$$ \frac{\text{observed value} - \text{hypothesized value}}{SE}$$

--

.alert[
$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{12.5 - 11}{\frac{10.7}{\sqrt{152}}} \approx 1.728$$
where the test statistic follows the $t$ distribution with $n-1$ df
]

---

### Motivating the p-value 

- We got a test statistic of 1.728. In other words...

--

.alert[
Given $\bar{x} \approx N\Big(11, \frac{10.7}{\sqrt{152}}\Big)$, what is the probability of observing a mean change in score at least 1.5 points away from the center (11) in a random sample of 152 children ages 3 - 5?
]

--

$$\Large{\Downarrow}$$

--

.alert[
Given the $t$ distribution with 151 degrees of freedom, what is the probability of observing a test statistic with magnitude 1.728 or larger?
]

---

### p-value

Given the $t$ distribution with 151 degrees of freedom, what is the probability of observing a test statistic with magnitude 1.728 or larger?

```{r echo = F, fig.height = 3}
lower <- -3
upper <- 3
ggplot(NULL, aes(c(lower,upper))) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dt, args = list(151), fill = "#00998a", xlim = c(lower, -1.728)) +
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dt, args = list(151), fill = "grey80", xlim = c(-1.728, 1.728)) + 
  geom_area(stat = "function", fun = dt, args = list(151), fill = "#00998a", xlim = c(1.728, upper)) +
  labs(x = "t", 
       title = "Visualizing the p-value")
```

```{r}
(p_value <- 2 * pt(-1.728, 151))
```

---

### General guide for interpreting the p-value


|  Magnitude of p-value |             Interpretation            |
|:---------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
| p-value < 0.01        | strong evidence against $H_0$         |
| 0.01 < p-value < 0.05 | moderate evidence against $H_0$       |
| 0.05 < p-value < 0.1  | weak evidence against $H_0$           |
| p-value > 0.1         | effectively no evidence against $H_0$ |
<br> 
<br>

**Note:** These are general guidelines. The strength of evidence depends on the context of the problem.

---

### Drawing the conclusion: Part 1

- A threshold can be used to decide whether or not to reject $H_0$ in favor of the alternative $H_a$

- This threshold is called the .vocab[significance level] and is usually denoted by $\alpha$

- If the p-value is less than $\alpha$, then we conclude there is sufficient evidence against $H-$ and we **reject the null hypothesis**

- Otherwise, we conclude that there isn't sufficient evidence against $H_0$ and **fail to reject the null hypothesis**

---

### Don't just rely on p-values

- Do not rely strictly on the p-value and significance level to make a conclusion!
--

- Suppose the significance level is 0.05
--

  + If the p-value is 0.05001, we fail to reject $H_0$
--

  + If the p-value is 0.04999, we reject $H_0$
--

- 0.05001 and 0.04999 are practically the same, yet they led to different conclusions. 
--

.alert[
Use confidence intervals and other statistical summaries to provide more context about the results.
]

---

### t-test for *Sesame Street* data 

```{r}
enc <- sesame_street %>%
  filter(treatment == "Encouraged")

t.test(enc$change, mu = 11, conf.level = 0.9, 
       direction = "two.sided")
```

90% confidence interval: [11.059, 13.941]
]
</center>

- Using a significance level of 0.1, what is your conclusion from the test? 

- Suppose you are advising a group of educators about whether they should spend additional time and money to encourage children to watch *Sesame Street*. Based on these results, would you advise the educators to spend the resources? Why or why not?

### Inference for difference in means $\mu_1 - \mu_2$

By the Central Limit Throem, when [the conditions](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring20/sta210.001/slides/lec-slides/01-review-ci.html#39) are met, 

$$(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) \sim N\left(\mu_1 - \mu_2, \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}} \right)$$

<br><br>

- We don't know $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ in practice, so we use the **standard error** in all calculations. 

$$SE (\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}$$

---

### Inference for difference in means $\mu_1 - \mu_2$

**Confidence Interval** to estimate $\mu_1 - \mu_2$

$$(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) \pm t_{df}^* \times \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}$$

$t^*$ follows a $t$ distribution with [degrees of freedom](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring20/sta210.001/slides/lec-slides/01-review-ci.html#54) computed in R. 

---

### Inference for difference in means $\mu_1 - \mu_2$

**Hypothesis Test**: Is there a difference in the means between Group 1 and Group 2?

- Null hypothesis: $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$
- Test statistic: 
  
  $$\frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) - 0}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}$$
  
- p-value: Calculated using the $t$ distribution with [degrees of freedom](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring20/sta210.001/slides/lec-slides/01-review-ci.html#54) computed in R.
