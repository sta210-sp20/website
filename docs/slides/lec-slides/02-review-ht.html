## Today's Agenda

- Calculating &amp; interpreting hypothesis tests

- Connecting hypothesis tests and confidence intervals

---

### *Sesame Street*

- *Sesame Street* is a television series designed to teach children ages 3-5 basic education skills such as reading (e.g. the alphabet) and math (e.g. counting)

- Today we are going to analyze data from an [study conducted by the Educational Testing Service](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED122799.pdf) in the early 1970s to test the  effectiveness of the program. 

&lt;img src="img/01/sesame_street.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---

### *Sesame Street* study

- Children from 6 locations around the United States (including Durham!) participated in the 26-week study. The children were split into two groups (`treatment`):
      + **Group 1**: Those who were encouraged to watch the show (assume watched regularly)
      + **Group 2**: Those who didn't get encouragement to watch the show (assume didn't watch regularly)

- Each child was given a test before and after the study to measure their knowledge of basic math, reading, etc.

- We will focus on the change in reading (identifying letters) scores (`change`)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

### Let's look at the data

`sesame_street.csv` is available in the datasets repo on GitHub.




```r
sesame_street %&gt;%
  slice(1:10)
```

```

### Exploratory Data Analysis - Univariate

&lt;small&gt;

```r
ggplot(data = sesame_street, mapping = aes(x = change)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Change in Reading Score (Post - Pre)" , 
       title = "Distribution of the Change in Reading Scores")
```

&lt;/small&gt;

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis - Univariate

- Calculate summary statistics for `change`
&lt;small&gt;

```r
sesame_street %&gt;%
  summarise(n = n(), min = min(change), median = median(change), max = max(change), 
            IQR = IQR(change), 
            mean = mean(change), std_dev = sd(change))
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 7
##       n   min median   max   IQR  mean std_dev
##   &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1   240   -22      9    41    15  10.8    11.2
```
&lt;/small&gt;

### 95% CI for mean change in reading score

The 95% confidence interval for the mean change in reading score is 

`$$\mathbf{[9.384, 12.224]}$$`

### Hypothesis Tests

### Question we want to answer

- Let's focus on the children who were encouraged to watch *Sesame Street*

- In general, those children watched the show regularly, so let's see if the show impacted their reading skills

.alert[
The mean change in reading scores after 26 weeks for children ages 3 - 5 is 11.

Is there evidence that mean change in reading score for children encouraged to watch *Sesame Street* is "significantly" different from the mean change in reading score for all children?

### Outline of a Hypothesis Test

- Identify the parameter of interest. 

- Identify a null hypothesis, `\(H_0\)`, that represents the baseline

- Set an alternative hypothesis, `\(H_a\)`, that represents the research question, i.e. what you're testing

- Conduct a hypothesis test under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true and calculate a p-value
    - The &lt;font class = "vocab"&gt;p-value&lt;/font&gt; is the probability of getting the observed outcome or a more extreme outcome given the null hypothesis is true

---

### Outline of a Hypothesis Test

- Assess the p-value. A small p-value means...
    
    a. The assumed (null) hypothesis is incorrect
    
    b. The assumed (null) hypothesis is correct and a rare event has occured 
    
- State a conclusion about the hypothesis based on the assessment of the p-value
--

  - Since event (b) is by definition rare, we will conclude a &lt;font color = "red"&gt;"small" p-value&lt;/font&gt; indicates that there is &lt;font color = "red"&gt;sufficient evidence to claim that the assumed hypothesis is false&lt;/font&gt;.
      - In other words, the data are not consistent with the assumed hypothesis 

--

  - When the p-value is &lt;font color = "blue"&gt; "not small"&lt;/font&gt;, we will conclude that there is &lt;font color = "blue"&gt;not sufficient evidence&lt;/font&gt; to claim the assumed hypothesis is false.


---

### Identify parameter &amp; hypotheses

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Null hypothesis, `\(H_0\)`&lt;/font&gt;: This is the baseline hypothesis, i.e. the "there is nothing going on" hypothesis. 
    - The mean change in reading score for children encouraged to watch the show is 11 (same as the mean for all children)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

- &lt;font class = "vocab"&gt;Alternative hypothesis, `\(H_a\)`&lt;/font&gt;: This is typically what you want to show, i.e. the "there is something going on" hypothesis 
    - The mean change in reading score for children encouraged to watch the show not 11 (different from the mean for all children)
    
`$$H_0: \mu = 11 \\
H_a: \mu \neq 11$$`


---

### Distribution `\(\bar{x}\)` under `\(H_0\)`

- We want to draw conclusions about `\(\mu\)`, so we'll use our best guess `\(\bar{x}\)`

- Recall from the Central Limit Theorem, when certain conditions are met (they are!), we know that 

`$$\bar{x} \sim N\Big(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\Big)$$`

--

- We conduct a hypothesis test under the assumption that `\(H_0\)` is true, so for this test

`$$\bar{x} \sim N\Big(11, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\Big)$$`



---

### Distribution `\(\bar{x}\)` under `\(H_0\)`

- We don't know `\(\sigma\)`, so we can use the standard error `\(s/\sqrt{n}\)` to approximate `\(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\)`.

- Thus, putting it all together, we know 

`$$\bar{x} \approx N\Big(11, \frac{10.7}{\sqrt{152}}\Big)$$`

--

.alert[
Given `\(\bar{x} \approx N\Big(11, \frac{10.7}{\sqrt{152}}\Big)\)`, what is the probability of observing a mean change in score at least 1.5 points away from the center (11) in a random sample of 152 children ages 3 - 5?
]

---

### Visualize


&lt;img src="02-review-ht_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


The shaded area represents the (approximate) probability of obtaining a sample mean at least as far away from the center as the one we observed given the true mean change is 11. 

---

### Test Statistic

- Let's quantify how "unusual" our observed sample mean is given `\(H_0: \mu = 11\)` is true

- We'll begin by calculating how "far away" the observed mean is from the center of the distribution under `\(H_0\)`

- The .vocab[test statistic] is the number of standard errors the observed value is from the hypothesized value. The general form of the test statistic is 
$$ \frac{\text{observed value} - \text{hypothesized value}}{SE}$$

--

.alert[
`$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{12.5 - 11}{\frac{10.7}{\sqrt{152}}} \approx 1.728$$`
where the test statistic follows the `\(t\)` distribution with `\(n-1\)` df
]

---

### Motivating the p-value 

- We got a test statistic of 1.728. In other words...

.alert[
Given `\(\bar{x} \approx N\Big(11, \frac{10.7}{\sqrt{152}}\Big)\)`, what is the probability of observing a mean change in score at least 1.5 points away from the center (11) in a random sample of 152 children ages 3 - 5?
]

`$$\Large{\Downarrow}$$`

.alert[
Given the `\(t\)` distribution with 151 degrees of freedom, what is the probability of observing a test statistic with magnitude 1.728 or larger?
]

### p-value

Given the `\(t\)` distribution with 151 degrees of freedom, what is the probability of observing a test statistic with magnitude 1.728 or larger?

&lt;img src="02-review-ht_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


```r
(p_value &lt;- 2 * pt(-1.728, 151))
```

```
## [1] 0.08603259
```

---

### General guide for interpreting the p-value


|  Magnitude of p-value |             Interpretation            |
|:---------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
| p-value &lt; 0.01        | strong evidence against `\(H_0\)`         |
| 0.01 &lt; p-value &lt; 0.05 | moderate evidence against `\(H_0\)`       |
| 0.05 &lt; p-value &lt; 0.1  | weak evidence against `\(H_0\)`           |
| p-value &gt; 0.1         | effectively no evidence against `\(H_0\)` |
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;

**Note:** These are general guidelines. The strength of evidence depends on the context of the problem.

---

### Drawing the conclusion: Part 1

- A threshold can be used to decide whether or not to reject `\(H_0\)` in favor of the alternative `\(H_a\)`

- This threshold is called the .vocab[significance level] and is usually denoted by `\(\alpha\)`

- If the p-value is less than `\(\alpha\)`, then we conclude there is sufficient evidence against `\(H-\)` and we **reject the null hypothesis**

- Otherwise, we conclude that there isn't sufficient evidence against `\(H_0\)` and **fail to reject the null hypothesis**

---

## Don't just rely on p-values

- Do not rely strictly on the p-value and significance level to make a conclusion!
--

- Suppose the significance level is 0.05
--

  + If the p-value is 0.05001, we fail to reject `\(H_0\)`
--

  + If the p-value is 0.04999, we reject `\(H_0\)`
--

- 0.05001 and 0.04999 are practically the same, yet they led to different conclusions. 
--

.alert[
Use confidence intervals and other statistical summaries to provide more context about the results.

### t-test for *Sesame Street* data 


```r
enc &lt;- sesame_street %&gt;%
  filter(treatment == "Encouraged")

t.test(enc$change, mu = 11, conf.level = 0.9, 
       direction = "two.sided")
```

```
## 
## 	One Sample t-test
## 
## data:  enc$change
## t = 1.7226, df = 151, p-value = 0.08701
## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 11
## 90 percent confidence interval:
##  11.05883 13.94117
## sample estimates:
## mean of x 
##      12.5
```

## In-class exercise 

&lt;center&gt;
p-value: 0.087
90% confidence interval: [11.059, 13.941]

- Using a significance level of 0.1, what is your conclusion from the test? 

- Suppose you are advising a group of educators about whether they should spend additional time and money to encourage children to watch *Sesame Street*. Based on these results, would you advise the educators to spend the resources? Why or why not?
