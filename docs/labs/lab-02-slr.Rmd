The primary goal of today's lab is to give you practice with some of the tools you will need to conduct regression analysis using R. An additional goal for today is for you to be introduced to your teams and practice collaborating using GitHub and RStudio. 

## Topics covered in this lab: 

**FILL IN**

# Getting Started

Each of your assignments will begin with the following steps.

## Clone Assignment Repo

## Clone the repo & start new RStudio project

- Go to the sta210-sp20 organization on GitHub (http://www.github.com/sta210-sp20). Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-01-review-r-**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.

```{r clone-repo-link, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=3}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01-intro-r/clone-repo-link.png")
```

- Click on the green **Clone or download** button, select **Use HTTPS** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with HTTPS** as in the image below). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

```{r new-project-from-gh, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=3, eval = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01-intro-r/new-project-from-gh.png")
```

- Go to https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers and login with your Duke NetId and Password.

- Click to log into the Docker container **STA 210 - Regression Analysis**. You should now see the RStudio environment. 

```{r paste-gh-repo-url, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=5}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01-intro-r/paste-gh-repo-url.png")
```

- Go to *File* `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` *New Project* `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` *Version Control* `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` *Git*. 

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*. You can leave *Project Directory Name* empty. It will default to the name of the GitHub repo.


- Click *Create Project*, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed the *Files* pane in RStudio. 

## Configure git 

If you are unable to push to GitHub, it may be because you need to configure git. Follow the steps below to configure git.

To do so, you will use the `use_git_config()` function from the `usethis` package. 

Type the following lines of code in the **console** in RStudio filling in your name and email address.

```{marginfigure}
The email address is the one tied to your GitHub account. 
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "GitHub username", user.email="your email")
```

For example, mine would be 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="matackett", user.email="maria.tackett@duke.edu")
```

If you get the error message

```{r eval=FALSE}
Error in library(usethis) : there is no package called ‘usethis’
```

then you need to install the `usethis` package. Run the following code in the console to install the package. Then, rerun the `use_git_config` function with your GitHub username and email address associated with your GitHub account.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.package("usethis")
```

Once you run the configuration code, your values for `user.name` and `user.email` will display in the console. If your `user.name` and `user.email` are correct, you're good to go! Otherwise, run the code again with the necessary changes.


## Packages

We will use the following packages in today's lab. 

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(knitr)
library(broom)
library(openintro) #package containing dataset
```

# Warm up

**Pick one team member to complete the steps in this section while the others contribute to the discussion but do not actually touch the files on their computer.**

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with a simple exercise.

## YAML: 

Open the R Markdown (Rmd) file in your project, change the author name to your **team** name, and knit the document.

## Commiting and pushing changes:

- Go to the **Git** pane in your RStudio. 
- View the **Diff** and confirm that you are happy with the changes.
- Add a commit message like "Update team name" in the **Commit message** box and hit **Commit**.
- Click on **Push**. This will prompt a dialogue box where you first need to enter your user name, and then your password.

## Pulling changes:

Now, the remaining team members who have not been concurrently making these changes on their projects should click on the **Pull** button in their Git pane and observe that the changes are now reflected on their projects as well.

**If you need a more detailed review on committing and pushing changes, see [Getting Starte](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring20/sta210.001/labs/lab-01-review-r.html#getting-started) from Lab 01.**

# Data: Gift aid at Elmhurst College

In today's lab, we will analyze the `elmhurst` dataset in the openintro package. This dataset contains information about 50 randomly selected students from the 2011 freshmen class at Elmhurst College. The data were originally sampled from a table on all 2011 freshmen at the college that was included in the article ["What Students Really Pay to go to College"](https://www.chronicle.com/article/What-Students-Really-Pay-to-Go/131435) in *The Chronicle of Higher Education* article.

You can load the data from loading the openintro package, and then running the following command: 

```{r eval = F}
data(elmhurst)
```

The `elmhurst` dataset contains the following variables: 

|  |  |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| `family_income` | Family income of the student |
| `gift_aid` | Gift aid, in ($ thousands) |
| `price_paid` | Price paid by the student (= tuition - gift_aid) |

# Exercises 

**To help get used to the group workflow, there are markers throughout the lab to indicate when each team member should be typing. The other group members should still contribute to the discussion when they are not typing; however, they should <u>not</u> change anything in RStudio.**

## Exploratory Data Analysis

**Team Member 1 types.**

1. Plot a histogram to examine the distribution of `gift_aid`. What is the shape of the distribution? Be sure the histogram has an appropriate binwidth to clearly see the shape of the distribution. *You can use the [ggplot reference](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/) page for more detail about adjusting binwidth in histograms.*

2. To better understand the distribution of `gift_aid`, we would like calculate measures of center and spread of the distribution.
Use the `summarise` function to calculate the appropriate measures of center (mean or median) and spread (standard deviation or IQR) based on the shape of the distribution from Exercise 1. Show the code and output, and state the measures of center and spread in your narrative.

3. Plot the distribution of `family_income` and calculate the appropriate summary statistics. Describe the distribution of `family_income` (shape, center, and spread) using the plot and appropriate summary statistics.  

4. Create a scatterplot to display the relationship between `gift_aid` (response variable) and `family_income` (predictor variable). Use the scatterplot to describe the relationship between the two variables. Be sure the scatterplot includes informative axis labels and title.

## Simple Linear Regression

**Team Member 1, knit, commit, and push your work. Team Member 2, pull to get the updated files and type the responses for the next few questions.**

5. Use the `lm()` function to fit a simple linear regression model to describe the relationship between an Elmhurst student's family income and the amount of gift aid they received. Use the code below to assign your model a name, and use the `tidy()` and `kable()` functions to neatly display the model output. *Replace X and Y with the appropriate variable names.*

```{r eval=FALSE}
_____ <- lm(Y ~ X, data = _____)
tidy(_____) %>% # output model
  kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3) # format model output
```

6. Interpret the slope in the context of the problem.

7. Does the intercept have a meaningful interpretation? If so, write the interpretation in the context of the problem. Otherwise, explain why the interpretation is not meaningful. 

8. When we fit a linear regression model, we make some inherent assumptions about the relationship between the response and predictor variables. We can check that the assumptions hold by analyzing the residuals. Over the next few questions, we will examine plots of the residuals to determine if the assumptions are met.

Let's begin by calculating the residuals and adding them to the dataset. Fill in the model name in the code below to add residuals to the original dataset using the `resid()` and `mutate()` functions.  

```{r eval=FALSE}
_____<- _____ %>%
  mutate(resid = residuals(_____))
```

**Team Member 2, knit, commit, and push your work. Team Member 3, pull to get the updated files and type the responses for the next few questions.**

9. One of the assumptions for regression is that there is a linear relationship between the predictor and response variables. To check this assumption, we will examine a scatterplot of the residuals versus the predictor variable. 

Create a scatterplot with the predictor variable on the *x* axis and residuals on the *y* axis. Be sure to include an informative title and properly label the axes. 

10. Examine the plot from the previous question to assess the linearity condition.  
- *Ideally, there would be no discernible shape in the plot. This is an indication that the linear model adequately describes the relationship between the response and predictor, and all that is left is the irredicubile error that can't be accounted for in the model.*
- *If there is an obvious shape in the plot (e.g. a parabola or fan shape), this means that the linear model does not adequately describe the relationship between the response and predictor variables.*

Based on this, does it appear that the linearity condition is satisfied? Briefly explain your reasoning. 

11. Recall that when we fit a regression model, we assume for any given value of $x$, the $y$ values follow the Normal distribution with mean $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x$ and variance $\sigma^2$. We will look at two sets of plots to check that this assumption holds.

We begin by checking the constant variance assumption, i.e that the variance of $y$ is approximately equal for each value of $x$. To check this, we will use the scatterplot of the residuals versus the predictor variable $x$.

Using the scatterplot from the previous exercise, does it appear the constant variance is satisfied? Briefly explain your reasoning. *Note: You don't need to know the value of $\sigma^2$ to answer this question.*

12. Next, we assess with Normality assumption, i.e. that the distribution of the $y$ values is Normal at every value of $x$. In practice, it is impossible to check the distribution of $y$ at every possible value of $x$, so we can check that the assumption is satisifed by looking at the overall distribution of the residuals. The assumption is satisified if the distribution of residuals is approximately Normal. 

**Team Member 3, knit, commit, and push your work. Team Member 4, pull to get the updated files and type the responses for the next few questions.**

Create a histogram and a Normal QQ-Plot of the residuals. Be sure to include an informative title and axis labels on each plot.

Based on these plots, does it appear the Normality assumption is satisfied? Briefly explain. 



13. The final assumption is that the observations are independent, i.e. one observation does not affect another. We can typically make an assessment about this assumption using a description of the data. Do you think the independence assumption is satisifed? Briefly explain your reasoning. 

## Prediction 

14. Suppose a high school senior is considering Elmhurst College, and she would like to use your regression model to estimate how much gift aid she can expect to receive. Her family income is $90,000. Based on your model, about how much gift aid should she expect to receive? Show the code and output and report the prediction and the appropriate interval in your narrative. 

15. Another high school senior is considering Elmhurst College, and her family income is about $310,000. Should she use your model to estimate the how much gift aid she can expect to receive? Briefly explain your reasoning.
