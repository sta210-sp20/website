Over the past ten years, recommendation systems have become increasingly popular as more companies strive to offer customized user experiences. Amazon recommends products you may like based on your browse and purchase history, Netflix recommends movies and TV shows based on your viewing history, and music platforms like Spotify recommend songs you may like based on your listening history. While these recommendation systems are built using a variety of algorithms, they are all trying to achieve the same goal: use the characteristics of the products/movies/music a user is known to like to figure out the products/movies/music the user may like but hasn't discovered yet.

See ["How Does Spotify Know You So Well?"](https://medium.com/s/story/spotifys-discover-weekly-how-machine-learning-finds-your-new-music-19a41ab76efe) for more information about Spotify's recommendation algorithms.
```

Today, we will continue form last week's lab and predict which songs a Spotify user will like. Before using the model for prediction, we will check the model assumptions and assess how well the model fits the data.

# Getting Started 

- Go to the sta210-sp20 organization on GitHub ([https://github.com/sta210-sp20](https://github.com/sta210-sp20)). Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-08-**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the warmup exercise. 

- Clone the repo and create a new project in your RStudio Docker Container ([https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu](https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu)). 

- Configure git by typing the following in the **console**.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="github username", user.email="your email")
```

## Password caching

If you would like your git password cached for a week for this project, type the following in the **Terminal**:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 604800'
```

You will need to enter your GitHub username and password one more time after caching the password. After that you won't need to enter your credentials for 604800 seconds = 7 days.

## Packages

You will need the following packages for today's lab: 

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(pROC)
# Fill in other packages as needed
```

## Data

The data in this lab is from the [Spotify Song Attributes](https://www.kaggle.com/geomack/spotifyclassification) data set in Kaggle. This data set contains song characteristics of 2017 songs played by a single user and whether or not he liked the song. Since this dataset contains the song preferences of a single user, the scope of the analysis is limited to this particular user.

You will use data `spotify.csv` to build the logistic regression model and test the performance of the model using the songs in `test_songs.csv`. 
Click [**here**](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Fall19/sta210.001/labs/data/spotify.csv) to download the dataset  `spotify.csv`, and click [**here**](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Fall19/sta210.001/labs/data/test_songs.csv) to download the dataset `test_songs.csv`. Upload both files to the to the `data` folder in your `lab-08` project.  

The  [Spotify documentation page](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/) contains a description of the variables included in this dataset.

# Exercises

We will pick up where we left last week, assess how well our model fits the data and use it to predict whether a user will like a song on Spotify. 

## Part I: The Model 

1. Let's begin by preparing the data for modeling. 

    - Refactor `key` so that it is categorical.
    - Refactor the variable `time_signature` so that it is categorical with three levels: "3", "4", "other".
    

2. Fit a model with the following variables: `acousticness`, `danceability`, `duration_ms`, `instrumentalness`, `loudness`, `speechiness`, and `valence`. Display the model output.

3. We consider adding `key` to the model. Conduct the appropriate test to determine if `key` should be included in the model. Display the output from the test and write your conclusion in the context of the data.

<br>
**Use the model you selected in Exercise 3 for the remainder of the lab.**
<br>

4. Use the model chosen from Exercise 3. If appropriate, interpret the coefficient for `key2` in the context of the data. Otherwise, state why it's not appropriate to interpret this coefficient.


## Part II: Model Assessment

In the next few questions, we will do an abbreviated analysis of the residuals. 

5. Use the `augment` function to calculate the predicted probabilities and corresponding residuals. 

6. Create a binned plot of the residuals versus the predicted probabilities.

7. Choose a quantitative predictor in the final model. Make the appropriate table or plot to examine the residuals versus this predictor variable.

8. Choose a categorical predictor in the final model. Make the appropriate table or plot to examine the residuals versus this predictor variable.

*In practice, you should examine plots of residuals versus <u>every</u> predictor variable to make a complete assessment of the model fit. For the sake of time on the lab, you will use these three plots to help make the assessment about the model fit.*

9. Based on the residuals plots from Exercises 6 - 8, is the model an appropriate fit for the data? Briefly explain your reasoning. 

10. Plot the ROC curve and find the area under the curve. Display at least 5 thresholds ("cut-off points") on the curve.

11. Do you think this model effectively differentiates between the songs the user likes versus those he doesn't?

## Part III: Prediction

12. You are part of the data science team at Spotify, and your model will be used to make song recommendations to users. The goal is to recommend songs the user has a high probability of liking. 

As a group, choose a threshold value to distinguish between songs the user will like and those the user won't like. What is your threshold value? Use the ROC curve to help justify your choice. 

13. Now let's put your model and decision threshold to the test! Use your model to calculate the predicted probability that the user will like the following two songs:
 
    - "Sign of the Times" by Harry Styles
    - "Hotline Bling" by Drake
    
The data for the songs can be found in *test_songs.csv*. Show the code and output for the predicted probabilities.

14. Using your decision threshold from Question 12, would you recommend "Sign of the Times" to this user? Would your recommend "Hotline Bling" to this user? Briefly explain your decision.

15. The user likes "Hotline Bling" but doesn't like "Sign of the Times". How well did your model identify the song the user would like? Briefly explain why your model performed well, or the limitations in the model or threshold that resulted in a poor performance.
