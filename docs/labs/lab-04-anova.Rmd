The goal of this lab is to use Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to compare means in multiple groups. Additionally, you will be introduced to new R functions used for [wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) and summarizing data.

# Getting Started 

- Go to the sta210-fa19 organization on GitHub ([https://github.com/sta210-fa19](https://github.com/sta210-fa19)). Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-04-anova-**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the warmup exercise. 

- Clone the repo and create a new project in RStudio Cloud. 

- Configure git by typing the following in the **console**.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="github username", user.email="your email")
```

## Packages

We will use the following packages in today's lab.

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(broom)
```

## Project name: 

Currently your project is called *Untitled Project*. Update the name of your project to be "Lab 04 - ANOVA".

# Warm up

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with a simple exercise.

## YAML: 

- Pick one team member to update the *author* and *date* fields at the top of the R Markdown file. Knit, commit, and push all the updated documents to GitHub.

- Now, the remaining team members who have not been concurrently making these changes on their projects should click on the **Pull** button in their Git pane and observe that the changes are now reflected on their projects as well.

## Data 

In today's lab, we will analyze the `diamonds` dataset from the ggplot2 package. Type `?diamonds` in the console to see a dictionary of the variables in the data set. This analysis will focus on the relationship between a diamond's carat weight and its color. 

Before starting the exercises, take a moment to read more about the diamond attributes on the Gemological Institute of America webpage: [https://www.gia.edu/diamond-quality-factor](https://www.gia.edu/diamond-quality-factor).


# Exercises 

The diamonds dataset contains the price and other characteristics for over 50,000 diamonds price from $326 to $18823. In this lab, we will analyze the subset of diamonds that are priced $1200 or less. 

1. Create a dataframe called `diamonds_low` that is the subset of diamonds priced $1200 or less. How many observations are in `diamonds_low`? 

When using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to compare group means, it is ideal to have approximately the same number of observations in each group. Therefore, we will combine the worst two color groups, I and J, and create a new color category called "I/J". Since `color` is an ordinal (`<ord>`) variable, we need to use the `recode_factor` function in the dplyr package to create the new category. 

```{marginfigure}
Refer to the [dplyr Reference page](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/recode.html) for more information about the `recode_factor` function.
```

Fill in the code below to refactor `color` with the new combined category.

```{r}
#create a new vector of the recoded values
diamonds_low <- diamonds_low %>%
  mutate(color = recode_factor(diamonds_low$color, "I" = "I/J", _____))
```

2. We begin by plotting the relationship between `color` and `carat`. As a group, brainstorm ways to plot the relationship between the two variables, then make one of the plots. Be sure to include informative axes labels and an informative title.

3. For each level of `color`, calculate the the number of observations at that level, the mean value of `carat` and and the variance of `carat`. 

4. Based on the plots and summary statistics, does there appear to be a relationship between carat weight the color of diamonds? Briefly explain your reasoning.

5. When using ANOVA to compare means across groups, we make the following assumptions (note how similar they are to the assumptions for regression): 

  - **Normality**: The distribution of the response, $y$, is approximately normal within each category of the predictor, $x$ - in the $i^{th}$ category, the $y$'s follow a $N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$ distribution. 
  - **Independence**: All observations are independent from one another, i.e. one observation does not affect another.
  - **Constant Variance**: The distribution of the response within each category of predictor, $x$ has a common variance, $\sigma^2$. 

Are the assumptions for ANOVA met? Comment on each assumption using the summary statistics and/or plots from previous exercises to support your conclusion. You may also calculate any additional summary statistics or make additional plots as needed.
  
*Regardless of your answer to Exercise 5, we will proceed with the remaining o f lab as if the assumptions are met.*

6. Use R to calculate and display the ANOVA table that can be used to assess if there is a statistically significant relationship the color and carat of diamonds.

7. Use the ANOVA table to calculate the "mean square total", i.e. the sample variance of `carat`. Show your calculations. You can put the calculations in a code chunk to use R like a calculator. 

8. What is $\hat{\sigma}^2$, the estimated variance of `carat` within each level of `color`. 

9. We can use ANOVA to test if the true mean value of `carat` is equal for all levels of `color`, i.e. 

$$ H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \dots = \mu_6$$

State the alternative hypothesis is the context of the data. You may use "mu" to represent $\mu$.

10. Based on the ANOVA table, what is your conclusion from the test of the hypotheses in the previous question? State the conclusion in the context of the data.

11. Let's examine the data further by calculating confidence intervals to estimate the mean value of carat for each level of color. Below is code to calculate the individual confidence intervals and plot them for easy comparison. Fill in the values for $\hat{\sigma}$ and the probability needed to calculate the critical value $t^*$. We would like a 95% familywise confidence level. 

*Recall: The probability in the `qt()` function should be the <u>cumulative</u> probability. For example, to find the critical value for a 90% confidence interval, we should input 0.95 for the probability.*


The formula for the confidence interval for the mean of group $i$ is 

```{marginfigure}
The critical value $t^*$ is calculated using the *t* distribution with $n-K$ degrees of freedom. 
```

```{marginfigure}
The standard error of the mean is calculated using $\hat{\sigma}$, the square root of the variance within each group calculated from the ANOVA table. This is the pooled standard deviation.
```

$$\bar{y}_i \pm t^* \frac{\hat{\sigma}}{\sqrt{n_i}}$$

```{r eval=FALSE}
n.groups <- diamonds_low %>% distinct(color) %>% count()
crit.val <- qt(_______, (nrow(diamonds_low)-n.groups$n))
sigma <- sqrt(_____)

conf.intervals <- diamonds_low %>%
  group_by(color) %>% 
  summarise(mean_carat = mean(carat), n = n(), 
            lower = mean_carat - crit.val * sigma/sqrt(n),
            upper = mean_carat + crit.val * sigma/sqrt(n))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=conf.intervals,aes(x=color,y=mean_carat)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), width = 0.1) + 
  labs(title="99% confidence interval for the mean value of carat",
       subtitle="by color") +
  coord_flip()
```

12. Based on this analysis, describe the relationship between the color and the mean carat weight in diamonds that cost $1200 or less. *Refer to the diamond documentation to recall what the color scale means.*

*You're done! Commit all remaining changes, use the commit message "Done with Lab 4!", and push. Before you wrap up the assignment, make sure the .Rmd, .html, and .md documents are all updated on your GitHub repo.*
