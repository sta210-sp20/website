# Introduction

```{marginfigure}
R is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.
```

The main goal of this lab is to introduce you to R and RStudio, which we will be using throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the course and to derive conclusions from the analysis of real-world data.

```{marginfigure}
git is a version control system (like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word but more powerful) and GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).
```

An additional goal is to introduce you to git and GitHub, which is the collaboration and version control system that we will be using throughout the course.

As the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer and statistician. If you're new to R, you should begin by building some basic fluency in R. Today's lab will focus on fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands. Starting next week, the labs will focus on concepts more specific to regression analysis.

To make versioning simpler, today's lab is individual. This will give you a chance to become more familiar with git and GitHub. Next week you’ll learn about collaborating on GitHub and will produce a single lab report as a team.

## Topics covered in this lab:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (data visualizations and numerical summaries)
- Statistical Inference
- Writing a lab report using R Markdown
- Tracking changes and submitting work using git and GitHub

# Getting Started

Each of your assignments will begin with steps in this section. You saw your TA demonstrate these steps, and they're outlined in detail below. Going forward, each lab will begin with a "Getting started" section but details will be a bit more sparse than this. You can always refer back to this lab for a detailed list of the steps involved for getting started with an assignment.

## Clone Assignment Repo

- Go to the sta210-fa19 organization on GitHub ([https://github.com/sta210-fa19](https://github.com/sta210-fa19)). Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-01-intro-r**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.

```{r clone-repo-link, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=3}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01-intro-r/clone-repo-link.png")
```

- Click on the green **Clone or download** button, select **Use HTTPS** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with HTTPS** as in the image below). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

```{r new-project-from-gh, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=3}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01-intro-r/new-project-from-gh.png")
```

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the STA 210 course workspace. Create a **New Project from Git Repo**. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the **New Project** button to see this option.

```{r paste-gh-repo-url, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=5}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01-intro-r/paste-gh-repo-url.png")
```

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box. Be sure "Add packages from the base project" is checked. 

- Click OK, and you should see the contents from your GitHub repo in the **Files** pane in RStudio. 

## Configure git

There is one more piece of housekeeping we need to take care of before we get started. Specifically,  we need to configure your git so that RStudio can communicate with GitHub. This requires two pieces of information: your name and email address.

To do so, you will use the `use_git_config()` function from the `usethis` package. 

Type the following lines of code in the **console** in RStudio filling in your name and email address.

```{marginfigure}
Use your first and last name. The email address is the one tied to your GitHub account. 
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="your name", user.email="your email")
```

For example, mine would be 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="Maria Tackett", user.email="maria.tackett@duke.edu")
```

If you get the error message

```{r eval=FALSE}
Error in library(usethis) : there is no package called ‘usethis’
```

then you need to install the `usethis` package. Run the following code in the console to install the package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.package("usethis")
```

Once you run the code, your values for `user.name` and `user.email` will show in the console. If your `user.name` and `user.email` are correct, you're good to go! Otherwise, run the code again with the necessary changes.

## Packages

We will use the following packages in today's lab. 

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(infer)
```

If you need to install any of the packages, you can run the code below in the **console**.
```{r,eval=F}
install.packages("tidyverse") 
install.packages("skimr")
install.packages("infer")
```

# Warm up

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises. 

## Project name: 

Currently your project is called *Untitled Project*. Update the name of your project to be "Lab 01 - Intro R". You should write an informative project name for each new project in RStudio Cloud.

```{r untitled-project, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01-intro-r/untitled-project.png")
```

```{marginfigure}
The top portion of your R Markdown file (between the three dashed lines) is called YAML. It stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.
```

## YAML: 

Open the R Markdown (Rmd) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and knit the document.

```{r yaml-raw-to-rendered, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01-intro-r/yaml-raw-to-rendered.png")
```

## Committing changes:

Then go to the Git pane in your RStudio.

If you have made changes to your Rmd file, you should see it listed here. Click on it to select it in this list and then click on **Diff**. This shows you the difference between the last committed state of the document and its current state with your changes. If you're happy with these changes, write "Update author name" in the **Commit message** box and click **Commit**.

```{r update-author-name-commit, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01-intro-r/update-author-name-commit.png")
```

You don't have to commit after every change, this would get quite cumbersome. You should consider committing states that are *meaningful to you* for inspection, comparison, or restoration. In the first few assignments we will tell you exactly when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses we will let you make these decisions.

## Pushing changes: 

Now that you have made an update and committed this change, it's time to push these changes to the web! Or more specifically, to your repo on GitHub. Why? So that others can see your changes. And by others, we mean the course teaching team (your repos in this course are private to you and us, only). 

In order to push your changes to GitHub, click on **Push**. This will prompt a dialogue box where you first need to enter your user name, and then your password. This might feel cumbersome. Bear with me... We *will* teach you how to save your password so you don't have to enter it every time. But for this one assignment you'll have to manually enter each time you push in order to gain some experience with it.


## Data 

Today's data comes from the Capital Bikeshare in Washington D.C. The Capital Bikeshare is a system in which customers can rent a bike for little cost, ride it around the city, and return it to a station near their destination. You can get more information about the bikeshare on their website, [https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/). We will read in the data from the file *bikeshare.csv* located in the *data* folder and store it in a data frame called `bikeshare`.


```{r read-data, eval=FALSE}
bikeshare <- read_csv("data/bikeshare.csv")
```

This dataset contains information about the number of bike rentals, environmental conditions, and other information about the each day in 2011 and 2012. In this lab, we will focus on the following variables: 

|  |  |
|----------|-------|
| `season` |1: Winter, 2: Spring, 3: Summer, 4: Fall |
| `temp` | Temperature (in $^{\circ}C$) &divide; 41 |
| `count` | total number of bike rentals |

# Exercises 

Before doing any analysis, we want to understand the basic structure of the data. One way to do this, is to look at the actual dataset. Type the code below in the **console** to view the entire dataset. 
```{r eval=FALSE}
View(bikeshare)
```

It is sometimes more useful to view a summary of the data structure rather than view the entire dataset. This is especially true for very large datasets, i.e. those with a very large number of observations and/or rows. We can use the `glimpse()` function to get a general idea about the structure of our dataset. This function can be very useful when importing data from a file such as a .csv file (like in this lab) to ensure that data imported correctly and that we have the number of observations (rows) and variables (columns) we expect. We can also use this function to see each variable's type (e.g. integer, character). 

```{marginfigure}
You can  type `??glimpse` in the console to learn more about the function and its syntax.
```

1. Use the `glimpse()` function to get an overview of `bikeshare`. 

```{r eval = F}
glimpse(bikeshare)
```

How many observations (rows) are in the `bikeshare` dataset? How many variables (columns)?

2. Before conducting statistical inference (or eventually fitting regression models),  we want to do an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get a sense of the main characteristics of the data. Much of EDA consists of visualizing the data but it also includes calculating summary statistics for the variables in our dataset. It is good practice to examine any variable that may be relevant to the analysis in the EDA. To keep today's lab manageable, we will only examine the three variables `season`, `temp`, and `count`.

There are many ways to calculate summary statistics for each variable, and we will use a few of them throughout the semester. For now, let's use the `skim()` function to calculate basic measures of center and spread.

```{r eval=FALSE}
bikeshare %>%
  select(season,temp,count) %>%
  skim()
```

What is the mean number of bike rentals? About 25% of the days in the data have a `count` above what value? 

3. Does it make sense to calculate measures of center and spread for the variable `season`? If so, explain why it makes sense. Otherwise, explain why the `skim()` function calculated these summary statistics for the variable `season` even if they don't make sense.

*This is a good place to pause, knit, and commit changes with the commit message "Added summary statistics  (Ex 1 - 3)". Push the changes to GitHub. Be sure you push all the files to GitHub by clicking the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane.*

```{marginfigure}
Check your lab-01 repo on the GitHub website (you may need to refresh the page in your browser) to ensure that all the documents you pushed are up-to-date.
```

## Visualizing Your Data

4. One important part of EDA is visualizing the data to get a better idea of the shape of the distribution for each variable. Data visualizations are also useful for examining the relationship between multiple variables.  There are a lot of ways to make plots in R; we will use the functions available in the `ggplot2` package.

The code below is used to create a histogram to visualize the distribution of `count`. Modify the code by writing an informative title and label for the x-axis.

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=bikeshare, mapping=aes(x=count)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title="______", x="______")
```


5. Sometimes you want to customize a plot by changing different features such as the color, marker types, etc. When plotting a histogram, one easy way to customize it is by changing its color. We'll look at two different ways to do this. 

First, using a color of your choice, include the option `color="_____"` inside of `geom_histogram()` function. Your code will look similar to the code below. Be sure to also include an informative title and label for the x-axis.

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=bikeshare, mapping=aes(x=count)) + 
  geom_histogram(______) +
  labs(title="______", x="______")
```

```{marginfigure}
This [ggplot2 quick reference](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour) has a long list of color options. You can also use [HTML color codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/).
```

Next, instead of `color="_____"`, include the `fill="______"` option inside of the `geom_histogram()` function using the color of your choice. It can be the same color as before or a new one.

What is the difference in the two plots? In other words, what is the difference in the way color is implemented when using `color` versus `fill`?

6. Describe the distribution of `count`. Your description should include comments about the shape, center, spread, and any potential outliers. You should use the histogram and summary statistics in your description. 

*This is a another good place to pause, knit, commit changes with the commit message "Added data visualization of count (Ex 3 - 6)", and push.*


Describe the relationship between the temperature and the number of bike rentals. 


7. We might expect the number of bike rentals to vary season-to-season. In the remainder of the lab, we will examine the relationship between `count` and `season`.

Recall from Exercise 2 that the variable `season` is currently stored in a numeric format. The numeric labels (1,2,3,4) are not very informative, so let's replace these values with the actual season names. Fill in the code below to update the variable `season`. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
bikeshare <- bikeshare %>%
  mutate(season = as.factor(season), #first change season to a factor variable type
         season = case_when(
           season == 1 ~ "Winter", 
           season == 2 ~ "______", 
           season == 3 ~ "______", 
           season == 4 ~ "______"
         ))
```

You can use the `glimpse()` to check that `season` updated correctly.


8. Let's visualize the differences in the number of bike rentals across seasons. Create a side-by-side boxplot to visualize the relationship between `season` and `count`. The code below will help you get started. Be sure to include an informative title along with informative labels for the x and y axes.

```{marginfigure}
[https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is a great resource as you learn `ggplot()`. Click **Reference** in the top right corner to see a list of the various plot types available in the ggplot2 package.
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = bikeshare, mapping = aes(x = season, y = count)) + 
         ______() +
         labs(_______)
```

Describe the relationship the two variables. In your description, include similarities and differences in the center and spread of the number of bike rentals across seasons. 

*This is a another good place to pause, knit, and commit changes with the commit message "Refactored season and visualized bike rentals vs. season (Ex 7 - 8)", and push.*

## Statistical Inference

9. While you may have observed differences in the typical number of bike rentals across season, we’d like to assess whether those differences are statistically significant or just due to random day-to-day variation. For now, let's focus on two season. Over the next few questions, we will conduct a hypothesis test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the mean number of bike rentals between Spring and Fall.
      
      -  State the null and alternative hypotheses in words.
      -  Now write the hypotheses in statistical notation. You can use "mu" to represent the mean parameter.

10. Next, we will calculate the test statistic and p-value using `infer` package. Fill in the value for `alternative = _____` in the `t_test()` function to calculate the p-value. The choices are `less`, `greater`, and `two_sided`. 
 
```{marginfigure}
Learn more about the `infer` package: https://infer.netlify.com/index.html
```

```{r eval = F}
# Calculate the test statistic and store it as obs_t
obs_t <- bikeshare %>% 
  t_stat(formula = count ~ season, 
         order = c("Spring", "Fall")) %>% 
pull(statistic)
```

```{r eval = F}
#display the test statistic
obs_t 
```


```{r eval = F}
# Calculate the p-value
bikeshare %>% 
  t_test(formula = count ~ season,
         alternative = "_____",  ## less, greater, or two_sided
         order = c("Spring", "Fall")) %>% 
  pull(p_value) #extract the p-value from the result
```

*This is a another good place to pause, knit, and commit changes with the commit message "Completed hypothesis test calculations in Ex 10", and push.*


11. Interpret the p-value in the context of the question. 

12. Use the p-value to state the conclusion in the context of the problem. *You can use [this table](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Fall19/sta210.001/slides/lec-slides/01-inf-review-pt1.html#51) to help assess the p-value.*

*You're done! Knit and commit all remaining changes, use the commit message "Done with Lab 1!", and push. Before you wrap up the assignment, make sure <u>all</u> documents are updated on your GitHub repo.*
