This page is a summary of all the changes made to the syllabus due to the transition to the virtual classroom. **<i>Anything stated on this page supersedes the corresponding statements in the original syllabus.</i>**

Please note that this is a living document that is likely to change as we adjust to the changes. You can see the date at the top of this section to see when the document was last updated. I appreciate your patience as we navigate these circumstances together. 

If you have any general questions about the remainder of the semester, please post them using the "remote-learning" tag on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/k532nlvarim38u). If you have a comment, you can post it on Piazza or submit it anonymously using [this form](.

## Lectures

The traditional lectures (i.e. going through slides and course content ) will be pre-recorded and made available on Sakai. You should watch the content videos in prepration for our regularly scheduled meeting. Please see <**INSERT DOCUMENT NAME HERE**> for the recorded lecture schedule.

We will meet via Zoom during our regularly scheduled lecture time, MW 10:05a - 11:20a EDT. You can find the link to the Zoom meeting on Sakai. During this time, I'll do a short review of the key concepts from the videos. This time will also be used for you to ask questions and work together on practice problems. 

I strongly encourage you to attend the live lecture sessions; however, I understand that you may be in a timezone or have other circumstances that won't make this possible. All lecture periods will be recorded and posted on Sakai. We will also utilize the Discussion Forum in Sakai, so you can ask questions and partcipate in discussion when you're able. 

## Labs

Will meet viz Zoom during the regularly scheduled lab times Th 3:05p - 4:20p or 4:40p - 5:55p EDT. You can find the link to the Zoom meeting on Sakai. Your TA will do a short introduction to lab, then you will work with your lab group in Breakout Rooms to complete the lab assignment for the day. Most of the lab assignments will be aimed at helping you complete the project. 

The TAs will spend time with each group during the lab session, so I strongly encourage yout attend the live lab sessions. I understand that you may be in a timezone or have other circumstances that won't make this possible, so I will provide some tips to help your group figure out a plan.

Lab sessions will <u>not</u> to be recorded.

## Homework

There are no major changes to homework. There will be 3 more homework assignments, making 6 total homework assignments for the semester. I will drop the lowest homework grade at the end of the semester. 


## Late policy 

The late policy has been updated to provide flexiblity during this time, while also helping you stay on top of the course work. 

Homework will be assigned on a Wednesday is due one week later on the following Wednesday at 11:59p EDT. You will have a 48-hour grace period, i.e. until Friday at 11:59p EDT to turn in the homework with no late penalty. I recommend using these as little as possible, but they are there to provide some stress relief.

After the 48-hour period, there is a 10% late penalty for each day the assignment is late. 

**Requests to waive late policy**. If you have extenuating circumstances that prevent you from completing an assignment by the end of the grace period, you can request to have the late penalty waived by submitting the [Late Policy Waiver Form](https://duke.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3lUoyf1YJkvBcpv). Please only fill out the form if you truly have extenuating circumstances and need additional relief beyond the grace period. 

## Exams

Exam 02 will be given online. It will be open-book, open-note, open everything but other people. The exam will be made available **April 20 to April 22**. The details are still being worked out, but it will likely be a timed exam, but you will have flexibility when you take it in that 2-day window.

The exam portion of your grade will be calculcated as follows: 

The higher grade of Exam 01 & Exam 02 will be worth 25% of the final course. The lower of the two grades will be worth 15% of the final course grade.  

## Project

You will still work on the final project with your lab group. Some of the due dates for the project have been pushed back; see the [project instructions](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring20/sta210.001/project/project.html) for the updated project timeline. Most of the remaining lab sessions will be assignments specifically geared towards helping you finish the project. 

If you have circumstances that will make working in the group unfeasible and would like to complete the project individually, please fill out the [Request for Individual Project form](https://duke.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5Bj47c7BSKH5oUJ). I will follow-up with you over email with next steps.

## Teamwork & Engagement

Given the change in the semester, the Teamwork & Engagement portion of the grade will be based only on the in-class questions from January 22 - March 5. You will receive full credit for this portion of the grade if you completed at least 60% of the in-class exercises.

## Grading 

The final grade will be calculated as follows

 <span></span>     | <span></span>  
-----------|---------------------------------
Homework | 25%
Labs | 15%
Max{Exam 01, Exam 02} | 25%
Min{Exam 01, Exam 02} | 15%
Final Project | 15%
Teamwork & Engagement | 5%
